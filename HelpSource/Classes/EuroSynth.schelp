DESCRIPTION::
EuroSynth implements a tuning system so the Pattern system of SuperCollider can be used on a eurorack modular system.

NOTE::
In order to use the CV functionality of EuroSynth you need a DC coupled interface.
Check link::Guides/EuroCollider:: for more information on this.
::


Before starting make sure you have wired everything up properly.
In this example we will use

LIST::
## The audio signal of the synth is connected to input 6 (including 0!) of the audio interface
## output 4 (including 0!) of the audio interface is connected to the cvIn of the module
## output 5 (including 0!) is connected to a gate input - this is optional
::

Also make sure that you have started the server with the appropiated device and number of out- and inputs, see link::Classes/ServerOptions::.

code::
// define new EuroSynth and tune it directly
e = EuroSynth(soundIn: 6, cvOut: 4, gateOut: 5).tune;

// after the tuning process finished we can use the synth in a pattern
(
Pdef(\myEuroPattern, Pbind(
	\type, \euro,
	\euro, e,
	\dur, 0.25,
	// as we will send gates instead of triggers
	// we can also use sustain to define the gate length
	\sustain, Pseq([0.2, 0.1], inf),
	\degree, Pxrand((0..12), inf),
)).play;
)

Pdef(\myEuroPattern).stop;

CLASSMETHODS::

PRIVATE:: addEventType


PRIVATE:: initClass

METHOD:: new
argument:: soundIn
link::Classes/SoundIn:: bus number where the audio signal of the module is arriving.
argument:: cvOut
link::Classes/Out:: bus number where the cv signal should be put out.
Needs to be connected to the CV in of the module.
argument:: gateOut
Optional link::Classes/Out:: bus number where a gate signal will be put out.
If this is not provided or nil it will spawn a new private audio link::Classes/Bus:: on the server where the output will be headed to in order to not put out on output 0 of the audio interface.
If you use the associated link::Classes/EuroSynth#-controlSynth:: manually you need to manually close the gate, e.g. via link::Classes/Function#-defer::
argument:: playMonitor
If true it will spawn a link::Classes/Ndef:: where the input of the module wil be played back on link::Classes/Bus:: 0 of the audio interface.
This is more of a convenience method and one should write its own link::Classes/Ndef:: or link::Classes/SynthDef:: to control the output of the eurorack module.
See link::Classes/EuroSynth#-monitor:: for more information.
argument:: negativeVoltage
If true it will also allow to output negative voltages.
Some modules are fine with this (e.g. MakeNoise STO) but others are not (e.g. Mutable Instruments Plaits), therefore it is turned off by default.


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: tune
Will run the (re-)tuning procedure for the synth.
argument:: baseFreq
Reference frequency which should be considered a starting point for the tuning process.
Should be a low note because we will go up the scale.
argument:: steps
Number of steps which will be used for tuning.
argument:: endRange
End of tuning range. 0.5 will cover around 4 octaves.
argument:: negativeSteps
Allows to also tune a number of negative steps as well.
This is only allowed if the EuroSynth instance was initiated with negativeVoltage set to true.
argument:: minMatch
midi steps which tollerate a deviation from the baseFreq during absolute tuning.


PRIVATE:: init

PRIVATE:: prTuningRoutine

METHOD:: tuningMap
A link::Classes/Dictionary:: in which the internal relation between CV and frequency is stored.

METHOD:: controlSynth
A synth which is used to control the output of the DC offset (aka CV) and the trigger of the EuroSynth.
This will also respawn if link::Classes/CmdPeriod:: was pressed.

METHOD:: resetTuning
Will reset the tuning.

METHOD:: isTuned
A boolean if the synth was already tuned or not.


METHOD:: freqCv
Allows to convert a frequency to a CV value.
This is used internally when called a pattern is used but can be useful for manula setting of frequencies.
argument:: freq

METHOD:: startControlSynth
Internal method which will start a synth which is responsible of emitting the proper DC offset to the synth and providing a gate.
Normally the synth is created automatically and also revived when stopped via link::Classes/CmdPeriod:: but in case you want to respawn it manually you can do it via this method.

METHOD:: monitor
Returns a link::Classes/Ndef:: which maps the soundIn argument to the link::Classes/Out:: 0 of the interface.
Use it like
CODE::
e = EuroSynth(...);
e.monitor.play;
e.monitor.stop;
::

METHOD:: clear
Will clear and free everything associated from the server and reset the tuning.
Use this before creating a new link::Classes/EuroSynth:: with the same output config but different settings, e.g. negativeVoltage.

PRIVATE:: curFreq

METHOD:: gateOut

METHOD:: negativeVoltage

METHOD:: soundIn

METHOD:: cvOut

PRIVATE:: addTuner
